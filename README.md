# libKakihara

This is just a repository of homebrew code that is shared among several projects
so I don't have to duplicate it elsewhere. I don't expect this to have any use
to others, but if you want to grab something go right ahead.

It's mostly be reinventing the wheel just for the fun of it. I know it's bad.
